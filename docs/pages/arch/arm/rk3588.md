## Rockchip SoC 3588

A pretty damn cool thing. I want the QuartzPro64 but idk where to get it, or whether its even released. Apparently it is for devs.

## Cortex A-76

The core of the RK3588 is 8x A-76 processors. Im guessing the same concepts mostly applies with ARMv8.2+ (microarch) and AARCH64 (ISA).

### Generic Timer

This is actually pretty cool. Because its per core. You can also have a system wide one, prob the system RTC on the RK3588. Which then gets piped into the 'processor system counter'. That system counter then gets piped into each core's generic timer.

## Features of RK3588

Theres prob quite a lot of features. Just like a snapdragon SoC. You prob have security modules or 'secure spaces' where you can quickly encrypt your data from RAM. And decrpyt just as easily. But quite hard for outsiders to hook onto software to try and decrypt remotely.

**GIC-CPU interface**: basically manages global interrupts. Prob from hardware and global CPU exceptions (non local)

**ETM**: Embedded trace macrocell arch specification. Good for debugging embedded systems. We have a trace of instructions executed and data that went in and out of the pipeline
