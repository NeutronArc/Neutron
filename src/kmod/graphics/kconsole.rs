// Main Console
// Should be run before any windowing. After windowing, must run `term` which emulates kconsole and interfaces with /dev/console and /dev/tty0..n
// For n terms running. tty0 should be the active term
// After Init. Becomes foregrounded

// Supports colors, fonts, etc.
// Runs as a userspace program listening on stdin, stdout, stderr
// And keyboard / mouse presses
