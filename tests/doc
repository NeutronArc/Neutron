FOR INTEGRATION TESTING OF HIGH LEVEL FUNCTIONALIY AND INTERFACES

REQUIRES A FULLY BUILT EXECUTABLE RUNNING IN A VM. SO SHOULD HOOK ONTO VM ENTRY AND TEST FOR A CERTAIN ARCH, specify in cli.

PRIORITISE RISCV. SOURCE CODE REMAINS SIMILAR IN SOME CASES SINCE I THINK A LOT OF THE KERNEL CAN BE SHARED
BUT SOME ARENT AND SO FOR CONVENIENCE IDK, build and integration test for the arch you want

RIGHT NOW: UNUSABLE UNTIL KERNEL.ELF FOR A CERTAIN ARCH RUNS ON QEMU AND YOU CAN HOOK INTO THE KERNEL. THEN SPECIFY A CUSTOM TESTING FRAMEWORK FOR THE ARCH DEPENDENT CODE AND USE THAT FOR THIS
I THINK THATS HOW IT WORKS
